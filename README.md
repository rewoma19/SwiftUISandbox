# SwiftUI by Example — Topic Notes 📘

Learning SwiftUI through [Paul Hudson’s SwiftUI by Example](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui).  

This repository contains topic-based notes, code snippets, and experiments.

## Goal 🧠

To build a solid understanding of each SwiftUI concept by:

- Writing small code samples

- Summarizing what each modifier or property wrapper does

- Reflecting on real-world usage

## Day 1

### Working with Static Text
